///Dictionary Component///

MUST-HAVE

As a user:
    -I can 
        - add a new Dictionary subject (parent)
        - add a new definition (child of subject)
        - delete a definition
        - delete a subject
        - add to flash-cards
            -will automatically create a flash card subject if one does not exist   (based off Dictionary Subject...if one already exists, you must select    which one to add it to).

            -will prompt you to add to specific subject category (can make      multiple categories under on Dictionary Subject).

            - can add to custom flash card subject regardless of Dictionary     Subject.
